# 📘 Personal English System

**Welcome to my personal English learning system, powered by real-world mistakes and AI-assisted improvement.**

This repository is a live, growing record of my journey to master English—not by learning in abstract, but by focusing on my own real mistakes and building from there.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Capture my own spontaneous English speaking or writing.
- Identify real mistakes in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, or fluency.
- Practice those mistakes repeatedly until they are corrected.
- Track my personal progress over time.
- Use AI and tools (like ChatGPT) to assist, reinforce, and test knowledge.

| File / Folder              | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `miguel-en-errors.json`    | The main file. A growing database of my personal English mistakes. |
| `README.md`                | Project documentation and system overview.           |
| *(coming soon)* `/scripts/`| For Python or JS tools that help manage or test the data. |
| *(coming soon)* `/prompts/`| AI prompt templates for each stage of the process.  |

## 🧩 System Stages

This system is structured in 5 key stages:

### 1. 🟢 Spontaneous Capture
I speak or write freely in English. AI records everything exactly as I say it—**no correction**.

### 2. 🟡 Error Analysis
AI identifies mistakes and generates a `.json` block for each one, including:
- Error type
- Suggested correction
- Explanation
- Status: `"Nuevo"`, `"En práctica"`, or `"Corregido"`

### 3. 🔵 Intensive Practice (Game Mode)
A custom interactive prompt lets me practice the exact mistakes I've made, in repetition cycles, until I improve.

### 4. 🟣 Record Management
The system tracks which errors have already been practiced and updates their status. This prevents working on the same ones too often and ensures all are covered.

### 5. 🔴 Certification & Evaluation
Once I've practiced errors, a separate prompt challenges me with tests to prove I’ve mastered the correction. Only then is the status changed to `"Corregido"`.

## 🧠 Methodology

This project follows the principle:  
> "Don’t just learn English. Learn **your** English."

By focusing on my **own real usage**, this method keeps learning relevant, efficient, and personal. Instead of consuming endless generic examples, I fix what actually causes me trouble.

---

## 🚀 Future Vision

This repository may evolve to include:

- Python tools for managing error records
- Visual dashboards showing progress
- Speech-to-text integrations for capturing audio input
- Exportable reports
- Support for other learners to fork and use this model

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal project, but others are welcome to fork it or adapt the idea for their own learning journey.

If you’re an English learner or teacher and want to collaborate, feel free to open an issue.
