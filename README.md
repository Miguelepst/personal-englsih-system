# 📘 Personal English Learning System

**Welcome to my personalized English learning system — driven by real mistakes and reinforced with AI.**

This repository documents my journey to mastering English, step by step, by capturing real usage, analyzing errors, and correcting them through intentional practice.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Capture spontaneous English (spoken or written)
- Identify actual errors in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, or fluency
- Practice those mistakes repeatedly through interactive exercises
- Track progress over time with status updates
- Use AI (like ChatGPT) to guide correction, practice, and evaluation

## 🧩 System Stages

The system is structured in **five progressive stages**:

### 1. 🟢 Spontaneous Capture
I speak or write in English naturally. AI records exactly what I say — with **no correction** — to preserve authentic usage.

### 2. 🟡 Error Analysis
AI detects errors and generates structured entries with:
- Mistake type
- Suggested correction
- Explanation
- Status (`"Nuevo"`, `"En práctica"`, `"Corregido"`)

These entries are stored in `errors.json`.

### 3. 🔵 Intensive Practice (Game Mode)
I work on my actual mistakes through a fun, interactive game-style prompt based on my `errors.json` log.

### 4. 🟣 Error Management
This stage tracks what’s been practiced and updates the status of each error. This avoids repeating the same errors too often and ensures all are covered over time.

### 5. 🔴 Certification & Evaluation
In this final stage, AI challenges me to prove I’ve mastered specific errors. Only after successfully passing is an error marked `"Corregido"`.

## 🧠 Philosophy

This project is built on one core idea:  
> “Don’t just learn English — learn **your** English.”

By focusing on **real, personal mistakes**, learning becomes more effective, relevant, and motivating.

---

## 🚀 Future Vision

This repository may evolve to include:

- Tools in Python/JavaScript for data handling
- Visual dashboards for tracking progress
- Speech-to-text support
- Reports and export features
- Templates for other learners to replicate this model
